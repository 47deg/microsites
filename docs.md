# What is a microsite?
A microsite is an instance of Jekyll, ready to publish static sites for your new library. Some of the benefits of having these auto-generated web pages are:

- You can write documentation easily in markdown format.
- Templates, layouts, styles and other resources will be able in an external CDN. We can easily change them, and updates will be reflected in every microsite.
- You don't have to deal with the styling.

Currently microsites includes two pages:

- Home: The landing page, the public face of your library.
- Docs (Optional): The page where the documentation of your library should be included. Probably you are watching the `Docs` page of this repo right now.
